# Infrastructure as Code Repository

## Overview
This repository serves as the authoritative source for all infrastructure definitions supporting the `cloud-native-ai-commerce` platform. It implements GitOps principles to manage the complete deployment lifecycle through declarative configuration.

## Value Proposition

### Single Source of Truth for:
- **Cluster Infrastructure**: Base Kubernetes configurations
- **Service Deployments**: Versioned manifests for microservices  
- **Environment Specifications**: Consistent dev/stage/prod definitions
- **Platform Components**: Databases, monitoring, and security

### Key Benefits:
- **Reproducible Environments**: Identical infrastructure from local to production
- **Auditability**: Complete change history with peer review
- **Disaster Recovery**: Infrastructure rebuild from versioned sources
